## 🏫 Training Details

- **Program:** Samsung Innovation Campus (SIC)
- **Club:** CP Club
- **Duration:** 10+ Days
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Data analysis
  - Logical filtering and decision making
  - Visualization using charts
  - Interpreting real-world datasets

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Engineering Branch Analysis Program** analyzes different engineering branches based on multiple academic and career-oriented factors such as:

- Dropout rates  
- Gender diversity  
- Job market stability  
- Industry collaboration  
- Placement statistics  

The goal is to extract meaningful insights that can help students make informed academic and career decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives of the Project

The program identifies:

1. **The highest-risk engineering branches for students**
2. **Branches with the best mix of gender diversity and career stability**
3. **Branches struggling despite strong industry collaboration**
4. **Visual representations of the analysis using bar charts**

## 🔍 Analysis Breakdown

---

### 1️⃣ Identifying the Branch with the Highest Risk for Students

#### Objective  
To determine which engineering branches pose the highest risk based on academic difficulty and poor career prospects.

#### Key Factors Considered
- **Dropout Rates (%)** – Higher than 8%
- **Current Demand** – Low or Very Low
- **Job Market Stability** – Low or Moderate

#### Methodology
Branches are classified as **high-risk** if they satisfy **all** of the following conditions:
- Dropout Rates (%) > 8%
- Current Demand = *Low* or *Very Low*
- Job Market Stability = *Low* or *Moderate*

---

### 2️⃣ Identifying the Best Mix of Gender Diversity and Career Stability

#### Objective  
To identify engineering branches that offer inclusive environments along with secure career prospects.

#### Key Factors Considered
- **Gender Diversity** – At least 30% female students
- **Job Market Stability** – Classified as *Stable*

#### Methodology
Branches are selected if:
- Gender Diversity ≥ 30%
- Job Market Stability = *Stable*

---

### 3️⃣ Identifying Branches Struggling Despite Strong Industry Collaboration

#### Objective  
To find branches that have strong industry support but still face challenges in demand and placements.

#### Key Factors Considered
- **Industry Collaboration** – Strong
- **Current Demand** – Low or Very Low
- **Placements (%)** – Less than 75%

#### Methodology
Branches are considered **struggling** if:
- Industry Collaboration = *Strong*
- Current Demand = *Low* or *Very Low*
- Placements (%) < 75%

## 📊 Data Visualization

- The analysis results are visualized using **bar charts**
- Charts help in:
  - Comparing branches
  - Identifying trends
  - Understanding risk and opportunity patterns clearly

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python / JavaScript *(as applicable)*
- **Libraries:** Matplotlib / Chart libraries
- **Concepts Used:**
  - Conditional filtering
  - Data analysis
  - Logical decision-making
  - Data visualization

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- Practical application of **data analysis concepts**
- How to interpret **career-related datasets**
- Filtering data using multiple conditions
- Presenting insights using **visual charts**
- Real-world problem solving under **Samsung SIC training**
